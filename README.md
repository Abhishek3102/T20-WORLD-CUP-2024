# T20 World Cup 2024 Analysis

This project provides an in-depth analysis of the T20 World Cup 2024, held in the USA and West Indies. The dataset used includes the following features:
- **matchId**
- **matchNumber**
- **teamA_shortName**
- **teamB_shortName**
- **matchResult**
- **startDate**
- **stage**
- **venue**

With these features, I have performed various operations and analysis to give a comprehensive understanding of what transpired during the tournament. The analysis covers match outcomes, team performances, and other significant events.

While this dataset offers valuable insights, I believe that the project could be greatly enhanced with additional features. If you have access to a more detailed dataset, please contact me. Your contribution would help make this project even better!

Feel free to explore the analysis and share your thoughts. Let's make this repository a valuable resource for cricket enthusiasts and analysts!
